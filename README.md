# Wordle Helper Back-End Group Project

We are The Imitation Game, a team consisting of BNTA Cohort 4 members, [Alex](), [Cristian](), [Suad](), [Rosalinda](), and [Rachel]().

<!-- What we've created, what inspired it -->

<!-- Include Tech Stack - how client-side was built -->

<br>

## Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

**Must-haves:**

_Helper Mode_
* Service logic
* Integration of an API (Controller), to send HTTP requests to progress game of Wordle
* Integration with database containing the words (DAO interface with database implementation)
* SQL file, with instructions to set up database and tables
* Text (csv) file including full list of words, together with probabilities and scores
* A Class which populates the Words table with data from text (csv) file

_Competitive Mode_
* Allow user to create User POJOs
* Create a user in database
* Allow user to input their number of guesses for a certain date
* Allow users to compare their performance vs the computer, for a certain date
* Allow user to retrieve their average guesses
* Play full game method (retrieve computer guess)


## Potential Extensions to MVP

**Nice-to-haves (if time):**

* Leaderboard
* Authentication

**Stretch objective**

* Integrate with Wordle - web-scrape number of guesses for user to win (not relying on self-reporting)
